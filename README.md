This is a food deliever web app developed as part of a corporate trainning!

Use docker-compose to build and run the services. 
Begin by initializing eureka-server and api-gateway.
Then initialize the databases and rabiitmq.

And finally, initialize all the other services.

You'll have the post the menu-items data using postman to both mongodb and neo4j.

If all goes well, the application should be up at port 8080.
